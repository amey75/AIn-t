# AIn’t – AI or Not Classifier 🔍🤖

With the rapid rise of AI-generated content — especially images and text that closely mimic human creativity — it's becoming increasingly difficult to tell what's real and what's synthetic.

After encountering several AI-generated images that looked strikingly human-made, I set out to tackle this challenge.

**AIn’t** is a full-stack machine learning application that detects whether a given image or piece of text is generated by AI or authored by a human — helping bring clarity in an age of content ambiguity.
